# 05. Microservices

## Overview
Microservices architecture is a design pattern where applications are composed of small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.

## Key Topics
- **Microservices Principles**: Decoupling, scalability, resilience, and autonomy.
- **Communication**: REST, gRPC, message brokers (Kafka, RabbitMQ).
- **Service Discovery**: Eureka, Consul, etc.
- **API Gateway**: Role and popular tools (Zuul, API Gateway).
- **Resilience Patterns**: Circuit breaker, retries, fallback.
- **Data Management**: Database per service, eventual consistency.
- **Deployment**: Containers, orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes).
